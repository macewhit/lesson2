            <h3>Alignment</h3>

            <p>Alignment was one of the first design principles brought to my attention when I first visted Zumbrunnen's mobile site. He has a strong flush left alignment that makes the movement on the page easy to follow and combines well with the white space. Nothing was done arbitrarily-- everything feels placed with a purpose.</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

            <p>As I viewed Tesla's mobile page (as well as their desktop site), I was struck with calm and simplicity. This made me think of the principle of Hick's Law since we aren't bombarded with a bunch of choices and it feels so simple. There's just an amazing picture of a car and a few buttons to choose from. This creates a nice white space element, as well. Without scrolling, the page has movement and hierarchy.</p>

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Alex Sakhnenko</p>

            <img src="/lesson2/images/Visual-Hierarchy.png" alt="A screenshot of Alex Sakhnenko's mobile site">
            <p>While there is a lot to take in when looking at Alex Sakhnenko's mobile site, it does not feel overwhelming. This is due to the visual hierarchy he has implemented. My eyes saw the large title, first. Then, I moved to some of the smaller surrounding information and picture. Lastly, I took in the navigation, buttons, and the tag on the right side. He also used aspects of alignment and repetition in his font. </p>
